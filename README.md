First implemented UIPageViewController and PageControl to explain the concepts of the app. 
Then added MapKit features. Users can search for a location and add annotations to the map.
To implement this we use a UISearchController, MKMapView, CLLocationManager, and MKAnnotationView properties. There is a protocol to pass the data from the UITableViewController to add an annotation to the map. 
The original purpose of the app was to track my hours spent at work. Many problems arise with this concerning privacy and battery usage. 
This code was inspired and reverse enginerred by this swiftUI tutorial by apple https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/interfacing-with-uikit
